### pokedex

this repository serves to record my progress in javascript studies and API consumption,
where I used them to create a simple pokedex, which I intend to gradually improve it!

If you want to download repo to run in your computer, will need to install node.js, and http-server to run it, whit node in your computer, open the terminal and run "npm i -g http-server" to install it, and to run just type "http-server" in the folder where is the index file
